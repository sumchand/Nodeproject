	<li><big><strong>What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity and has its own state and behavior.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><big><strong>What is method overloading in Java?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters in a class. It allows methods to perform similar tasks with different input parameters or data types.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><big><strong>What is encapsulation in Java?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping data and code together into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal implementation details and provides access to the data through public methods.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><big><strong>Explain the difference between abstraction and encapsulation.?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer</strong>:&nbsp;Abstraction focuses on the behavior and characteristics of an object, hiding unnecessary details. Encapsulation focuses on data hiding and bundling data and code into a single unit.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>What is the purpose of the "final" keyword in Java?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer</strong>: The "final" keyword can be applied to variables, methods, and classes. It makes a variable unchangeable, a method unmodifiable, and a class uninheritable.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>What is the difference between static and instance variables?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer: </strong>Static variables belong to the class and are shared among all instances of the class. Instance variables are unique to each instance of the class.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>What are access modifiers in Java?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer:</strong> Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of classes, variables, methods, and constructors. The main access modifiers in Java are "public," "private," "protected," and default (no modifier).</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>Explain the concept of inheritance in Java.</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer:</strong> Inheritance is a mechanism where a class inherits properties and behaviors from another class. It allows for code reuse, method overriding, and the creation of class hierarchies.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>What is method overriding in Java?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer:</strong> Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>What is a constructor in Java?</strong><br>
	Answer: A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It has the same name as the class and is automatically called when an object is created.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>What is the difference between the "==" operator and the "equals()" method?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer</strong>: The "==" operator compares object references, checking if they point to the same memory location. The "equals()" method compares the content or values of objects to check for equality.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>What are the different types of exceptions in Java?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer: </strong>Exceptions in Java are divided into two types: checked exceptions (which are checked at compile-time) and unchecked exceptions (which are not checked at compile-time).</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>Explain the concept of method overloading versus method overriding.</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer</strong>: Method overloading involves having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass.</big><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><big><strong>What is the purpose of the "static" keyword in Java?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Answer:</strong> The "static" keyword is used to define a member (variable or method) that belongs to the class itself, rather than to individual instances of the class. Static members can be accessed without creating an object of the class.</big></p>
