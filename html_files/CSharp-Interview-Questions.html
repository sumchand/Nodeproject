            <p>What is C# and what are its key features?</p>

<p>C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft.<br />
Key features of C# include:<br />
Object-oriented programming (OOP) support<br />
Strong typing<br />
Garbage collection<br />
Language interoperability<br />
Asynchronous programming with async/await<br />
Exception handling<br />
LINQ (Language Integrated Query)<br />
Delegates and events<br />
Generics<br />
Reflection<br />
Explain the difference between value types and reference types in C#</p>

<ul>
	<li>Value types store the actual value, and reference types store a reference to the value&#39;s memory location.</li>
	<li>Value types include primitive types (e.g., int, float) and structures.</li>
	<li>Value types are stored on the stack.</li>
	<li>Reference types include classes, interfaces, arrays, and strings.</li>
	<li>Reference types are stored on the heap, and the variable holds a reference to the memory location.</li>
	<li>Assignment of a value type creates a copy of the value, while assignment of a reference type copies the reference, not the underlying object.</li>
	<li>What is the purpose of the &quot;using&quot; statement in C#? How does it relate to IDisposable?</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;using&quot; statement is used for automatic disposal of objects that implement the IDisposable interface.<br />
IDisposable is used to release unmanaged resources like file handles, database connections, etc.<br />
The &quot;using&quot; statement ensures that Dispose() method of IDisposable is called when the block of code is exited, even if an exception occurs.<br />
It helps with resource management and prevents resource leaks.<br />
What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in C#?</p>

<p>An abstract class can have both defined and undefined (abstract) members, while an interface can only have undefined members (method signatures, properties, events).<br />
A class can inherit from only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces.<br />
An abstract class can have fields and provide default implementations, while an interface cannot have fields or implementations.<br />
An abstract class is typically used when creating a base class with common functionality, while an interface is used for defining contracts that classes can implement.<br />
How does exception handling work in C#? Explain the try-catch-finally block.</p>

<p>Exception handling allows you to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.<br />
The &quot;try&quot; block encloses the code that may throw an exception.<br />
The &quot;catch&quot; block specifies the type of exception to catch and the code to execute when that exception occurs.<br />
Multiple catch blocks can be used to handle different exceptions.<br />
The &quot;finally&quot; block contains code that is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs.<br />
It is used for cleaning up resources and is optional.<br />
When an exception is thrown, the runtime searches for the first suitable catch block to handle it and executes the corresponding code.<br />
What is the difference between &quot;==&quot; and &quot;Equals()&quot; in C#?</p>

<p>&quot;==&quot; is an equality operator used for comparing values.<br />
&quot;Equals()&quot; is a method used for comparing the equality of objects.<br />
For value types, &quot;==&quot; compares the values directly, while &quot;Equals()&quot; performs the value comparison.<br />
For reference types, &quot;==&quot; compares the references, while &quot;Equals()&quot; performs the reference or value comparison depending on how it&#39;s implemented.<br />
Describe the concept of polymorphism in C# and provide an example.</p>

<p>Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common&nbsp;</p>
