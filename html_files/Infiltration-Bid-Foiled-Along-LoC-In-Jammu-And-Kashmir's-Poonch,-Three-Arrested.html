<p>&nbsp;A major infiltration attempt to smuggle arms and drugs was thwarted by the Indian Army in which three people were arrested after a shootout near the border fence along the Line of Control in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, news agency PTI quoted officials as saying.&quot;One Army soldier and one of the arrested infiltrators were injured in the firing at forward Karmara village in Gulpur sector in the early hours of the day,&quot; PTI quoted officials as saying. They said border troops detected suspicious movement and confronted the persons which resulted in a gunfight.</p>
